A Linear Equation solver for Unity C#
=================

This repo contains a series of classes to solve two simultaneous equations using matrices. There is also an example scene in the repo where the solver is use to deterimne if 
two agents are colliding or not. For more info, have a look at this medium post: https://medium.com/@shahriyarshahrabi/use-matrices-to-program-agents-which-avoid-collision-with-each-other-in-unity-a8d2446bb591
